# Pixel-Music-Player
This is a small website based on a tutorial, but with added functionality. 

Volume controls and a looping function were added and styled.
CSS is slightly tweaked from the original tutorial in order to add visual feedback when pressing the buttons.

Music and Images were changed from the tutorial as well.
